# Ecobee Temperature Monitor
This project utilizes the Ecobee API to poll data from an Ecobee remote temperature sensor. It is currently configured to extract temperature sensor data and local temperature (from the weather report), though it can easily be expanded to include more data (such as data from from other sensors or the Ecobee thermostat).
